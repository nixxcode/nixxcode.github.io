What makes Jvm-Brotli uniquely helpful, is that including it in your own project is as simple as adding a single Maven or Gradle dependency. \r It will automatically download and use the correct native library based on the platform the dependent app is currently running on.

This got quite technical and complex, because Javalin’s static content handling is built on top of Jetty, so it was necessary to override the default content handling with our own robust approach.\r Unsurprising for such a significant change, a few bugs and issues surfaced after we released the changes. However, many continuous integration tests and some bug fixes later, the result of our work speaks for itself.
