intro: |
  Hello, my name is Dominik. I currently reside in Shrewsbury, United Kingdom. I am actively seeking employment as a software engineer.<br/><br/>
  
  I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for open source projects. I fell in love with software development when I tried my hand at modding the game Minecraft, and have been aspiring to become a professional developer ever since.<br/><br/>
  
  While it's true I don't have any experience as a commercial developer, I am definitely not a stranger to technology. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science, coupled with a rich set of technical skills and experiences from previous employment.<br/><br/>
  
  To demonstrate my skills and competencies, I invite you to have a look at my employment history (click the individual year bubbles for more information), as well as the open source projects I am involved with. You can also find a link to my Github profile in the top navigation bar<br/><br/>
  
  If you wish to get in touch, please contact me at dominik.petrovic87@gmail.com, thank you.
