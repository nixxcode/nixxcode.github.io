      <p>Hello, my name is Dominik (@nixxcode on Github) and I currently reside in Shrewsbury, United Kingdom. I am actively seeking employment as a software engineer.</p>

<p>I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for open source projects. I fell in love with programming when I tried my hand at modding existing software, and have been aspiring to become a professional developer ever since.</p>

<p>I have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, coupled with a rich set of technical skills and experiences that I acquired from previous employment, as well as my participation in various open source projects.</p>

<p>To demonstrate my skills and competencies, I invite you to take a closer look at some of the projects I am involved with. You can also find a link to my Github profile in the top-right corner.</p>

<p>The technologies and concepts I am most skilled with are: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>JNI</mark>, <mark>Kotlin</mark>, <mark>Maven</mark>, <mark>Gradle</mark>, <mark>Git</mark>, <mark>HTTP</mark>, <mark>REST API</mark>, <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>jUnit</mark>, <mark>Integration Testing</mark>, <mark>CI - Continuous Integration</mark></p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12 details"><h4>Jvm-Brotli</h4>
<a href="//github.com/nixxcode/jvm-brotli" target="_blank" class="link">github.com/nixxcode/jvm-brotli</a></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p class="quote">Lightweight, cross-platform Java library for the Brotli compression format.
</p><p>While working to implement <mark>Brotli</mark> compression in Javalin (see next project), I found the <mark>Java</mark> offerings for Brotli were out of date, buggy, or unsuitable for performance reasons. That’s when I decided to create my own <mark>cross-platform library</mark> with the goal of making Brotli easy to access for Java developers and consumers on all platforms.</p>

<p>What makes Jvm-Brotli uniquely helpful, is that including it in your own project is as simple as adding a single <mark>Maven</mark> or <mark>Gradle</mark> dependency. It will automatically download and use the correct <mark>native library</mark> based on the platform the dependent app is currently running on. This takes away all the complexity of <mark>JNI</mark>, making Brotli simple to include and easy to use.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12 details"><h4>Javalin</h4>
<a href="//github.com/tipsy/javalin" target="_blank" class="link">github.com/tipsy/javalin</a></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p class="quote">A simple and modern Java and Kotlin web framework.
</p><p>I have been working closely with Javalin’s maintainer to fix bugs and introduce brand new features to this fantastic and easy-to-use web framework.</p>

<p>My greatest contribution to the project was implementing <mark>Brotli</mark> compression capabilities for both static and dynamic <mark>web content</mark> (You can read about it <a href="https://javalin.io/news/2019/07/21/javalin-3.2.0-released.html">here</a>). This got quite technical and complex, because Javalin’s static content handling is built on top of <mark>Jetty</mark>, so it was necessary to override the default content handling with our own robust approach.</p>

<p>Unsurprising for such a significant change, a few bugs and issues surfaced after we released the changes. However, many <mark>continuous integration</mark> tests and some bug fixes later, the result of our work speaks for itself. Javalin now supports the Brotli compression format, as well as having a streamlined, unified handler for both dynamic and static <mark>HTTP</mark> responses.</p>

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  
    <div class="row clearfix layout layout-top-middle">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12 details"><h4>Career Break</h4><p>November 2017 - Present</p></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p>I have been on a career break for the past 2 years. It has been necessary due to personal (family-related) reasons.</p>

<p>During the last few months, my circumstances have changed, allowing me more personal time to work on open source projects. This has been invaluable for learning new skills and keeping existing ones up-to-date. I am now ready and eager to return to my professional life, and particularly excited about starting my new career as a software developer.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p>At Britpart, I maintained a network of over 300 devices (PCs, laptops, tablets, printers, etc). This maintenance was both physical, as well as virtual (via <mark>Active Directory</mark> on <mark>Windows Server 2012</mark>).</p>

<p>During calm periods, I also worked on implementing various <mark>scripts</mark> and processes to make the IT department more efficient as a whole. Most notably, I implemented a third party e-mail signature solution (called Exclaimer) for Microsoft Outlook across the entire business network, and managed it centrally via AD and <mark>scripted</mark> rules. This ensured a uniform and professional e-mail signature for all users across the business.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p>At Guestline, I offered second line technical support to business customers via telephone, e-mail and remote desktop connections. It was a busy role where meeting tight deadlines and SLA targets was critical.</p>

<p>During calmer periods, I also went above and beyond my duties to improve troubleshooting processes for the entire support department. I accomplished this by creating <mark>SQL</mark> scripts to automate the analysis and repair of common <mark>database</mark> faults.</p>
