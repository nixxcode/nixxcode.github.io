    I have been on a career break for the past 2 years. It has been necessary due to personal (family-related) reasons. 
    
    During the last few months, my circumstances have changed, allowing me more personal time to work on open source projects. This has been invaluable for learning new skills and keeping existing ones up-to-date. I am now ready and eager to return to my professional life, and particularly excited about starting my new career as a software developer.

    At Britpart, I maintained a network of over 300 devices (PCs, laptops, tablets, printers, etc). This maintenance was both physical, as well as virtual (via <mark>Active Directory</mark> on <mark>Windows Server 2012</mark>). 
    
    During calm periods, I also worked on implementing various <mark>scripts</mark> and processes to make the IT department more efficient as a whole. Most notably, I implemented a third party e-mail signature solution (called Exclaimer) for Microsoft Outlook across the entire business network, and managed it centrally via AD and <mark>scripted</mark> rules. This ensured a uniform and professional e-mail signature for all users across the business.

    At Guestline, I offered second line technical support to business customers via telephone, e-mail and remote desktop connections. It was a busy role where meeting tight deadlines and SLA targets was critical. 
    
    During calmer periods, I also went above and beyond my duties to improve troubleshooting processes for the entire support department. I accomplished this by creating <mark>SQL</mark> scripts to automate the analysis and repair of common <mark>database</mark> faults.

    I started freelance IT work on the side when I began my university studies. The job primarily involved assisting home and small business users with common IT problems such as OS installation, LAN setup, hardware repairs, etc.
